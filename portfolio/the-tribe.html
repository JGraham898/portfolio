                        THE TRIBE is a brand new app designed for people
                        involved in <b>start-up accelerator programs</b>. It
                        allows founders, program organisors, investors and
                        mentors to communicate, network, keep track of events
                        and attendees, and advertise their businesses.

                    <p>
                        The founder of THE TRIBE informed me that he wanted to
                        offer a <b>founder-first approach</b> - in other words,
                        his priority was to provide an excellent user experience
                        for the start-up founders using the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, as the website was set up without any initial
                        UX research, there were some
                        <b>areas of confusion</b> which needed to be addressed.

                    <p>
                        I set out to
                        <b>redesign the community functionality features</b> of
                        the app. The goal was to help users network, upload
                        information about their business, and find the
                        information they need in a seamless, intuitive and
                        aesthetically pleasing way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the <b>sole UX designer</b>, I led the entire
                        project. I conducted research and user testing, came up
                        with design ideas, and created Figma wireframes.

                        The app initally had a minimum viable product (MVP)
                        release that had been built by the engineers without any
                        UX design input. My first step was to
                        <b>conduct interviews with 5 users</b> in the primary
                        focus group (startup founders).

                    <p>
                        My goals were:

                        <li>Empathise with user needs</li>

                            Measure user satisfaction with the current
                            experience
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        During the interviews,
                        <b
                            >I observed them interacting with the app/website

                    <p>

                        proceeding with design sketches, I consulted with The

                        affect my ability to resolve these problems.
