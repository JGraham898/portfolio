                        I wanted my app name to not only reflect the health and
                        fitness, but also convey a feeling of positivitya nd
                        good vibes. I brainstormed some ideas with one of my
                        sample users and together we came up with the name
                        ENDORFIT - a combination of "fit" and "endorphin" to
                        convey the idea that the app will help to get users'
                        endorphins pumping and make them feel good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To come up with UI ideas for Endorfit, I looked at other
                        fitness apps on the market (such as Strava, which was
                        mentioned favourably by some of my users). I identified
                        features which I thought would fulfil my user needs, as
                        well as answering my "How might we?" questions.
                    </p>

                    <p>This part of my research yielded the following ideas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fun "medals" and "trophies" to gain when you achieve
                            certain things
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Connect with friends and give an "exercise together"
                            option
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Include songs/playlists to suit your workout
                            mood/tempo
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Provide instructional videos to help people
                            understand how to do the workouts
                        </li>
                        <li>Provide helpful tips on exercise and fitness</li>

                        I created some flowcharts using the Lucid app to
                        visualise the journey the user would take through the
                        app and help me to plan how the different pages of the
                        app will flow into each other.

                        Working from my user journey flowcharts, I created some quick wireframes in Figma. I then showed these to some of my users to gather their feedback and work out which direction to go in next.
